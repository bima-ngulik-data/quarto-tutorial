# Test

## Placing Colorbars

Colorbars like in indicate the quantitative extent of image data. Placing in a figure is non-trivial because room needs to be made for them. The simplest case is just attaching a colorbar to each axes:[^1].

[^1]: See the [Matplotlib Gallery](https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/subplots_axes_and_figures/colorbar_placement.html) to explore colorbars further

```{python}
#| label: fig-color
#| fig-cap: "test"
#| code-fold: true
#| column: screen-inset
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

fig, axs = plt.subplots(2, 2)
fig.set_size_inches(20, 10)
cmaps = ['RdBu_r', 'viridis']
for col in range(2):
    for row in range(2):
        ax = axs[row, col]
        pcm = ax.pcolormesh(
          np.random.random((20, 20)) * (col + 1),
          cmap=cmaps[col]
        )
        fig.colorbar(pcm, ax=ax)
plt.show()
```

This can be dangerous

## Look this

This is also important

\## Overview

See \@fig-simple in \@sec-plot for a demonstration of a simple plot.

See \@eq-stddev to better understand standard deviation.

## Plot {#sec-plot}

```{python}
#| label: fig-simple
#| fig-cap: "Simple Plot"
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.plot([1,23,2,4])
plt.show()
```
